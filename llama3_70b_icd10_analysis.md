# Llama 3 70B for ICD-10 Prediction: GPU Requirements and Feasibility Analysis

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive research, **Llama 3 70B is NOT suitable for running on a single GPU with only 10 texts for ICD-10 prediction**. Here's why:

## Key Findings

### 1. GPU Memory Requirements for Llama 3 70B

**Minimum VRAM Requirements:**
- **FP16 (Half Precision)**: ~140 GB VRAM
- **4-bit Quantized (INT4)**: ~35 GB VRAM minimum
- **8-bit Quantized (INT8)**: ~70 GB VRAM

**Current Single GPU Limitations:**
- Consumer GPUs (RTX 4090): 24 GB VRAM
- Professional GPUs (A100): 80 GB VRAM
- H100: 80 GB VRAM

### 2. Quantization Analysis

Even with aggressive 4-bit quantization:
- Requires minimum 35 GB VRAM just for model weights
- Additional memory needed for KV cache and intermediate calculations
- Performance degradation with heavy quantization affects medical accuracy

### 3. ICD-10 Prediction Specific Requirements

**Model Performance in Medical Coding:**
- BioBERT achieved F1-scores of ~77% for ICD-10-CM classification
- Smaller models (8B parameters) show F1-scores of 65-72%
- Medical coding requires high accuracy due to billing and legal implications

**Current State-of-the-Art:**
- Most successful ICD-10 systems use smaller, specialized models
- BERT-based models (340M-1.5B parameters) perform well for medical coding
- Llama 3 8B would be more appropriate for this task

## Recommendations

### 1. Better Alternatives for ICD-10 Prediction

**Option A: Llama 3 8B (Recommended)**
- VRAM requirement: 12-16 GB (with quantization)
- Fits on single RTX 4090 (24 GB)
- Sufficient performance for medical text classification
- Faster inference for real-time applications

**Option B: Specialized Medical Models**
- BioBERT, ClinicalBERT, or similar
- Much smaller memory footprint (1-4 GB)
- Pre-trained on medical text
- Proven performance on ICD-10 tasks

**Option C: Multi-GPU Setup for Llama 3 70B**
- Requires 2-4 high-end GPUs
- Distributed inference across multiple devices
- Significantly higher cost and complexity

### 2. Hardware Recommendations for Single GPU

**For ICD-10 Prediction Task:**
```
Recommended: Llama 3 8B
- GPU: RTX 4090 (24 GB) or RTX 3090 (24 GB)
- RAM: 32-64 GB system RAM
- Storage: 50+ GB SSD space
- Expected performance: ~65-70% F1-score
```

**If insisting on Llama 3 70B:**
```
Minimum: Multi-GPU setup
- GPUs: 2x RTX 4090 (48 GB total) with 4-bit quantization
- OR: 4x RTX 3090 (96 GB total) for better performance
- RAM: 128+ GB system RAM
- Storage: 200+ GB SSD space
```

### 3. Performance Considerations

**Inference Speed:**
- Llama 3 8B: ~2-5 seconds per batch of 10 texts
- Llama 3 70B (quantized): ~10-30 seconds per batch of 10 texts
- Medical applications often require real-time responses

**Accuracy Expectations:**
- Smaller specialized models often outperform large general models
- Medical domain benefits from targeted pre-training
- 70B model may be overkill for ICD-10 classification

## Technical Details

### Memory Breakdown for Llama 3 70B
```
Model weights (4-bit): ~35 GB
KV Cache (10 texts): ~1-2 GB
Intermediate calculations: ~5-10 GB
Total minimum: ~40-47 GB VRAM
```

### Quantization Impact on Medical Tasks
- 8-bit quantization: Minimal accuracy loss (< 1%)
- 4-bit quantization: 2-5% accuracy degradation
- Further quantization: Significant quality loss for medical applications

## Conclusion

**For ICD-10 prediction with 10 texts:**

❌ **Llama 3 70B on single GPU**: Not feasible with current consumer hardware
✅ **Llama 3 8B on single GPU**: Recommended approach
✅ **Specialized medical models**: Most cost-effective solution

The 70B model's advantages (better general reasoning, few-shot learning) don't justify the massive hardware requirements for a specific medical classification task where smaller, specialized models perform comparably well.
