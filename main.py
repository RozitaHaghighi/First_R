    You are an expert medical professional. Analyze the clinical text below and identify all diseases, medical conditions, and diagnoses mentioned or implied.

    INSTRUCTIONS:
    - List each disease/condition on a separate line
    - Use standard medical terminology
    - Include both primary and secondary conditions
    - Be specific (e.g., "Acute myocardial infarction" not just "heart problem")
    - If no clear diseases are identified, output: None

    SYMPTOM GUIDANCE by ICD-10 Category:
    {symptom_guidance}

    Use this symptom mapping to help identify potential diseases when symptoms are mentioned in the text. Consider which ICD-10 categories the symptoms might belong to and identify corresponding diseases.
    
    IMPORTANT: Do NOT write explanations, reasoning, or your thinking process. Output ONLY the disease names
